        <ol>
            <li>Good understanding of users and how they use the data</li>
            <li>practice the interaction. also dress appropriately.
                <ol>
                    <li>intro, interaction, closing</li>
                    <li>explain their participation is completely voluntary, they are free to stop participating at any time, if they wish to stop participationg this will not negatively affect their relationship with your company/institution. There is no right or wrong.</li>
                    <li> you should remain neutral, keep control of the interaction. stay positive and remind ppl that they are being helpful.</li>
                    <li>end of session remind them about the goals of the interaction and what you plan to do with their data. ask if they have anything else to add. thank them for their participation. (this is the debreifing period)</li>
                    <li>may need to consider an ethics review board if engaging in group user interaction study.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Gathering info:
                <p>
                    The problem space: who are the users? wh, where why and how do they currently accomplish the task? what do users perceive are problems with their current practices? uer's wish list for improving how they currently accomplish their task?
                </p>
                <p> design is data-driven: surveys, interview, focus groups.</p>
                <p>Quantitative data: info that can be transcribed numerically (gives us the what)</p>
                <p>Qualitative statistics: thematic information, data from interviews, narative. both important (gives us the why)</p>
            </li>
            <li>Types of users/stakeholders:
                <p>primary, secondary, tertiary. shoes => wearer primary, coach => secondary, shoe company => tertiary.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Techniques for learning about the user: naturalistics observation (quantitative and qualitative, best used first and to plan for future data gathering processes), surveys (get users opinions, get self report and opinion on someone, rank, dichotomous. downside is bias like recall or sample or social desirability), focus groups (users between 5-10, design team: moderator, note taker, media person. quantitative, Bad side: group think due to social influence, other ppl influence), interviews (skilled interviewer, bad: time intensive, qualitiative aanalysis something). use these all in a cycle.</p>
                <p>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Presenting the findings:
                <p>
                	stats! range (min-max), mean, median. all about the user
                </p>
                <p>USER INTENTION == SYSTEM RESPONSIBILITY, heirarchical task analyses, current ui critique</p>
            </li>
